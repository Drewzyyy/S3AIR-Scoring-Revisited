# S3AIR-Scoring-Revisited

## THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT YET READY FOR GENERAL USAGE AND/OR DISTRIBUTION! THIS SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO WORK AND THINGS ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BREAK!
### This repository is therefore targeted exclusively at advanced users and contributors who are willing to test out the mod and submit detailed issues.

Work-in-progress Sonic 3 AIR mod that adds a ranking system to the game.

### Known Issues

 - The DEZ2 results screen just doesn't work properly. Fixing it will require rewriting the results screen to not use the DMA queue.
 - P Ranks are saved seperately of E through S ranks, although they don't show on the results screen.
 - Achievements Plus support is only partially implemented as the custom achievements do not have triggers.

Contributions are welcome! Please open a pull request with your fixes.
